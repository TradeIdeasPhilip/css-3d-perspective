# 3D Perspective in CSS

All of the transform are done in CSS.

The sides of the cubes are `div`’s.
I use transforms like `rotateY()` and `translateZ()` to move the  `div`’s where I want them in 3D space.
And I use a couple more CSS properties to adjust the camera.
The rest is automatic.

I only create rectangles.
CSS turns those into trapezoids.

## How to Use

Go to https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/css-3d-perspective/.
Move your mouse to adjust the vanishing point.
Click on a cube to make it spin.
